## 👋🏻 Introduction 

**Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study:** where we put the pedal to the metal in the wild world of data analysis! This is the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where we'll ride through a structured data analysis process, covering the steps of **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.** So, saddle up and let's spin those data wheels! 🚲💨

## 🚲 Backgroud
Since 2016, Cyclistic has been a successful bike-share program in Chicago, growing to include 5,824 bikes at 692 stations citywide. With flexible pricing options like single-ride passes and annual memberships, Cyclistic appeals to a wide range of customers. Recent financial analysis shows that annual memberships are more profitable than one-time rides. Director Moreno plans to focus on converting occasional riders into members to drive future growth. By analyzing historical trip data, Moreno's team aims to create effective marketing strategies tailored to Cyclistic's user base.

## 🤔 Data Step
